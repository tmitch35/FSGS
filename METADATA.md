## METHODS
### *I.	Overview of Fall 2018 Fieldwork*
In fall of 2018, one low-female population (i.e., < 18% female) and one high-female population (i.e., >>18% female) of *Lobelia siphilitica* were mapped and exhaustively phenotyped in order to characterize 1) the spatial distribution of sexes, 2) plant fitness, and 3) the local environment. The first of these populations, “Jennings Woods: Daryl Carver’s land” (JWDC), was located—as the name suggests—adjacent to Jennings Woods in Ravenna, Ohio. Specifically, JWDC contained 102 mapped ramets in fall of 2018 (16 females, 83 hermaphrodites, 2 non-flowering individuals, 1 gynomonoecious individual, and 1 individual of unknown sex). Thus, considering females and hermaphrodites only, JWDC was 16.2% female. The second population, “Pearson Metropark: Parking Lot 2” (PS), was located in Pearson Metropark in Toledo, Ohio. Specifically, PS contained 158 mapped ramets in fall 2018 (63 females and 95 hermaphrodites). Thus, PS was 39.9% female.  

Data collected in fall of 2018 are currently being analyzed to determine the relative informativeness of certain traits (e.g., plant height, total flower number, etc.) as they relate to plant fitness and population structure, such that sampling design can be refined before revisiting these populations in fall of 2019. Additionally, two more populations of *L. siphilitica* (one low-female, one high-female) will be selected for mapping and phenotyping in 2019. Thus, a total of four populations will be sampled in the upcoming field season (and likely again in fall of 2020), such that the extent of fine-scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS) in populations of disparate sex ratios can be compared within the same sampling period.  
### *II.	Population Mapping*
Using methods based on Olson et al. (2006), all flowering ramets—and 2 ramets that did not flower—within PS and JWDC were tagged and mapped to the nearest 1 meter by measuring the distance and azimuth from the plant to one or more fixed points. Measurements were taken using a Bosch GLR825 Laser Measure and military-style lensatic compass, and the relative locations of each plant were calculated using triangulation and trigonometric calculations. Positions of mapped plants were displayed on a Cartesian plane using the current version of GGPLOT2 in R Studio. Finally, the latitude and longitude of each population was recorded using an iPhone 8.  
### *III.	Field Sampling*
During flowering, all flowering ramets were sexed based on floral sex expression: hermaphroditic or “perfect” flowers have bluish-purple anther cylinders, whereas female or “pistillate” flowers have papery- white anther cylinders. Total flowers per plant were recorded at fruiting (i.e., once flowering had ceased), and up to 2 flowers per plant were collected in ethanol-filled Eppendorf tubes for measures of flower morphology (see Caruso et al., 2003). I will measure the latter as tube length, as well as the length and width of the lower lobe, averaged across all flowers collected from a given ramet. Plant height at flowering was also recorded, measured from the ground to the bottom of the inflorescence, as plant height is a critical determinant of dispersal distance (i.e., seed shadow). Inflorescence length was measured as well, as that correlates with flower number, and the height of the top flower will likely determine seed shadow (A.L. Case, pers. comm.). Finally, leaves were collected from each ramet for subsequent molecular analyses.  

During fruiting, up to three seed capsules from each maternal plant were collected: one from the top of the inflorescence, one from the middle, and one from the bottom, because those were more likely to have different pollen donors due to differing complements of hermaphrodite sires. Total fruits per plant could not be recorded in fall of 2018 due to logistical conflicts; however, this information will be recorded in subsequent field seasons such that total seed production per plant can be estimated.  
### *IV.	Lab and Greenhouse Work*
Seeds collected from maternal plants are currently being assessed for weight and number, percent germination, germination rate, and progeny sex ratio. Additionally, I will select ~30 hermaphroditic offspring per maternal  
hermaphrodite to calculate pollen viability, which will entail removing pollen from anther cylinders, adding lacto-phenol aniline blue stain, and subsequently Vortexing and pipetting the solution onto slides (Case and Caruso, 2010). At the microscope, I will score ~200 pollen grains per flower for viability (viable pollen grains stain blue, whereas inviable pollen grains do not). Each slide will be scored twice to improve accuracy.  
### *V.	Environmental Data*
From the GPS coordinates I collect and the WorldClim database, I will infer annual temperature, mean temperature during the reproductive season, and annual precipitation. Soil from clusters of females and hermaphrodites was also collected to assess clay content, pH, nitrogen, and phosphorous. Obvious signs of habitat heterogeneity were noted but not yet mapped. Light intensity will likely be measured at each site during the 2019 and 2020 field seasons, as it has been shown to affect female fecundity in other studies (Saniga, 2000).
### *VI.	Molecular Analyses*
To characterize mtDNA haplotypes, I will sequence three mitochondrial genic regions: *atp6*, *pseudo-rps12* (*Ψrps12*), and the first intron of *nad7* (B. Adhikari, unpublished data). Using multiple markers will 1) provide sufficient sequence variation for mitochondrial haplotype comparison and 2) allow me to test for intergenic recombination, which would not be possible otherwise. I will also haplotype cpDNA by sequencing the *psbK*–*rps16* intergenic region, which contains five variable features and resolves into ten unique haplogroups (Madson, 2012). Analyzing both cpDNA and mtDNA will be necessary because, unlike most plant species, there is low linkage disequilibrium between plastid and mitochondrial variation in Lobelia siphilitica (B. Adhikari, unpublished data). Consequently, chloroplastic DNA will provide a more reliable source of information about population history, whereas mitochondrial DNA will be more informative of CMS types (A.L. Case, pers. comm.).  

I will use double digest RAD-Seq (ddRAD-Seq) to sequence and genotype nuclear DNA, which is more economical than traditional restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) in cases where no reference genome is available (Peterson et al., 2012). All plants within standing populations will be genotyped using this method, as well as a subset of their progeny. I will then conduct a parentage analysis to identify all paternal and maternal plants, which will allow me to assess realized male reproductive success. I will apply the same methods to identify kinship within standing populations (e.g., parents, siblings, clones) to elucidate the relative influence of gene dispersal and clonality in generating fine-scale spatial genetic structure.
### *VII.	Statistical Analyses*
To characterize the spatial distribution of adult plants in the four study populations, I will employ the O-ring statistic O(r), which calculates “[the expected number of plants] in a ring at distance r from an arbitrary point” (Lara-Romero et al, 2016). I will also calculate “the slope of the linear regression of O(r) on the logarithm of the spatial distance r for each population” to compare the extent of aggregation among populations (Lara-Romero et al, 2016).  

I will use the current version of the Stacks pipeline to analyze raw ddRAD-Seq data, which I will subsequently export to GENEPOP to calculate population genetic measures such as summary F-statistics, expected heterozygosity, total number of alleles, etc. (Peterson et al., 2012).  

To assess FSGS resulting from isolation by distance, I will use a spatial genetic autocorrelation analysis implemented in SPAGeDi version 1.4 to estimate genetic similarity between pairs of individuals (Hardy & Vekemans, 2002). To compare the extent of FSGS among populations, I will calculate the Sp statistic for each, which combines elements of kinship, neighborhood size, effective gene dispersal rate, and effective population density into a single statistical output (Vekemans & Hardy, 2004). I will also quantify the association between FSGS and plant spatial aggregation by conducting a simple correlation analysis, as both O(r) and spatial genetic autocorrelation rely on a ring-based approach (Lara-Romero et al., 2016).  

Finally, I will use multiple ANCOVA models to test whether variation in environmental data (e.g., latitude, temperature, precipitation, light intensity) correlate with variation in the strength of FSGS among populations.
