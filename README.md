# Fine-scale Spatial Genetic Structure (FSGS) in Gynodioecious *Lobelia siphilitica*
## PROJECT ABSTRACT
Natural plant populations often exhibit fine-scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS), wherein genotypes are non-randomly distributed in space (Laporte et al., 2001; Vekemans & Hardy, 2004; Lara-Romero et al., 2016). For genes underlying sexual phenotype, FSGS can result in the aggregation of sexes. This phenomenon is well-documented in gynodioecious species, in which females and hermaphrodites co-occur within populations (e.g., McCauley & Taylor, 1997; DeCauwer et al., 2012; Sanderson et al., 2016). Such clustering of similar phenotypes can have important implications for plant fitness, generating non-random mating patterns that, in turn, affect reproductive success (Olson et al., 2006; DeCauwer et al., 2010). Thus, understanding the spatial context in which ecological interactions occur is critical for understanding the evolutionary process itself (McCauley & Taylor, 1997).  

In many gynodioecious plants, including *Lobelia siphilitica*, sex determination involves combinations of cytoplasmic and nuclear genes. Specifically, cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) genes in the mitochondrial genome result in a loss of male function if expressed, rendering plants female. However, restorer genes (*Rf* factors) in the nuclear genome can suppress specific CMS genes, thereby restoring male function and hermaphroditism.  

In *Lobelia siphilitica*, a short-lived perennial herb native to eastern North America, two main theories are predicted to explain the maintenance of gender dimorphism: reproductive compensation and the cost of restoration. Reproductive compensation refers to the idea that females do not produce pollen and are, therefore, able to allocate more energy into producing more and/or better-quality seeds (McCauley & Bailey, 2009; Proell, 2009). Cost of restoration refers to the condition wherein carrying excess (i.e., mismatched) restorer alleles comes at a fitness cost in most plants (Delph et al., 2007), and in *L. siphilitica*, that cost is a reduction in pollen viability (McCauley & Bailey, 2009; Caruso & Case, 2013). However, for a variety of reasons (e.g., maternal inheritance of sex, seed dispersal mechanism, clonality), females are more likely to be flanked by other females, and non-CMS hermaphrodites are more likely to be flanked by other hermaphrodites (Olson et al., 2006). In addition, hermaphrodites carrying extra, costly restorer alleles are often located next to females. Thus, under pollen limitation, reproductive compensation may not be realized in an ecological context (Caruso et al., 2012). Likewise, restored hermaphrodites may not experience cost if spatial proximity to females imparts a seed-siring advantage. Both of these “exceptions to the rule” have been demonstrated, but never within the same species (Olson et al., 2006; DeCauwer et al., 2010).  

Therefore, it is my goal to compare the effect of fine-scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS) on male and female reproductive success in natural populations of *Lobelia siphilitica*. However, I must first confirm the presence of FSGS and the associated clustering of phenotypes in these populations. Additionally, I must determine what causes FSGS and what leads to among-population variation in its extent. In this way, I hope to gain a holistic understanding of fine-scale spatial genetic structure in *Lobelia siphilitica*, while pushing the field of plant evolutionary ecology forward in the process.  

## EXPERIMENTAL QUESTIONS AND ASSOCIATED HYPOTHESES  
[Q1]: Are natural populations of *Lobelia siphilitica*, a gynodioecious perennial herb, spatially structured?  
**[H1]: Populations of *Lobelia siphilitica* are predicted to exhibit strong FSGS for a variety of reasons, resulting in the aggregation of similar sexual phenotypes; however, the strength of FSGS likely varies between genomes, such that mitochondrial and chloroplastic haplotypes are significantly more structured than their respective nuclear counterparts.**  

[Q2]: If populations are spatially structured, what factors underlie FSGS and/or account for among-population differences in the strength of fine-scale spatial genetic structure?  
**[H2]: Factors that generate FSGS likely include mating system (i.e., unequal reproductive success), founder effects, selection, low effective population density, low effective seed dispersal distance, clonality, herbaceous growth form, genetic drift, animal-dispersed pollen, microhabitat heterogeneity, the spatial aggregation of adult plants, self-compatibility, and isolation by distance; however, out of these, low effective seed dispersal distance and low effective population density are predicted to have the greatest influence on FSGS. Among-population differences in FSGS are thought to be caused by differing 1) population densities, 2) degrees of adult-plant aggregation, and 3) habitat conditions. It is also predicted that the extent of FSGS will vary between high- and low-female sex ratios, such that populations with high-female sex ratios exhibit stronger FSGS than those with low-female sex ratios, particularly with respect to chloroplastic and mitochondrial haplotypes.**  

[Q3]: Does FSGS influence plant fitness and, if so, how?  
**[H3]: Fine-scale spatial genetic structure is predicted to affect plant fitness by 1) decreasing female fitness under pollen limitation (caused by variation in local sex ratio), 2) increasing male fitness in restored hermaphrodites, and 3) increasing inbreeding depression in demes consisting of related individuals.**
